# A/B Test

This project was to conduct an A/B test on a dataset from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhangluyuan/ab-testing?select=ab_data.csv ). 
The dataset has the following fields:
-user_ids
-timestamp
-group (treatment/control)
-landing page (old/ new version)
-converted (1/0)

Background: I proposed a scenario of the average yearly conversion rate for landing page and the example target conversion rate that we want to reach with the new version.
Analysis: Using an A/B test with the correct sample size, we can conclude whether we recommend to roll-out the new landing page design.
